# DCOE Baseline hardening guide (WIP)

Follow the recommendations in this article [Penetration Testersâ€™ Guide to Windows 10 Privacy & Security](https://hackernoon.com/the-2017-pentester-guide-to-windows-10-privacy-security-cf734c510b8d) article if they apply.

Be advised the article is a little outdated and some things may no longer be compatible with the latest version of windows or some recommendations could've have changed in light of recent security incidents. DO YOUR RESEARCH AND HAVE GOOD BACKUPS!
